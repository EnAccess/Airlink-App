# Model

ThingsBoard.io ✓: Open Source or Managed PaaS: Monolithic/microservice interchangeable, IoT stream processing, device/partner management and and IoT Analytics platform in Docker on a DigitalOcean droplet with Aiven-Cassandra + PostGreSQL managed dbs on DigitalOcean. One downloadable package architecture, can be clustered 
Crate.io ❌: Open Source or Managed PaaS: CrateDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a NoSQL foundation. Customers often use CrateDB to store and query machine data. This is because CrateDB makes it easy and economical to handle the velocity, volume, and diversity of machine and log data.
Kaaproject.org: Open Source or Managed PaaS: microservices type IoT stream processing, device/partner management and and IoT Analytics platform in Docker connecting to a Redis + PostGreSQL. No monolithic download so steeper initial learning curve
OpenRemote.io ❌: Assissted deployment only, no managed cloud options
custom development: IaaS: DigitalOcean droplet with custom stream-processing code, managed Redis db buffer for incoming data providing high-rel front end, then managed PostGreSQL db for IoT metrics. Custom device/partner management workflows on another platform e.g. Airtable-like no-code platform
