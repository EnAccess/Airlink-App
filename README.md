# AirLink Docs

> AirLink is an open source framework ([MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) to manage IoT devices connecting to compatible servers via BluetoothÂ® gateways. The protocol provides an interoperable communication standard and example code for wire-free communication between related devices and an IoT server, using smartphones as gateways. 
> 
> It also comes with a flow for tracking lost devices via crowd-sourced detection, and 'PAYGO' functionality to support use cases for financed devices.
>
> AirLink was developed to help entrepreneurs get over the main IoT development hurdles quickly and focus on their unique application

### AirLink Components
AirLink is mainly a communication methodology, and proposes three components of which two are required at any given time. Each component has an open source library to get started with. Click each link to learn more.

### AirLink Functional Highlights
Smartphone-gateway connectivity, an opinionated device lifecycle, a flow for lost/stolen devices and built-in PAYGO functionality are what set AirLink apart from open-source IoT solutions.

#### AirLink Data flow
AirLink leverages Bluetooth and GSM to flow data from the device to the server via the app, and vice versa. Data is structured for minimum overhead for devices and plug-and-play adding of new device types without server/app redos.

#### AirLink devices during manufacture, provisioning and use
AirLink covers the full device lifecycle, with a complete path to get devices registered in the server, exchange data and control PAYGo functionality.
![AirLink interactions during device manufacture, provisioning and use](AirLink%20Docs/IoT_Communications_and_Components_spec_-_App_Architecture.png)

#### AirLink Lost/Stolen Devices
Leveraging the RF connectivity, AirLink 'community-sources' device security, where anyone with an AirLink app can help find lost devices without sharing private data or compromising device PAYGo

#### Integration with Solaris and Angaza
AirLink devices can exchange tokens with Angaza and Solaris servers. The AirLink server recognizes the type of provider based on a configuration setting, and connects with Angaza or Solaris servers to get the latest PAYGo token. This provides out-of-the-box integration for those devices that support Nexus Token or OpenPAYGO Token.
