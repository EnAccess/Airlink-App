# AirLink Docs

> AirLink is an open source framework ([MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) for Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) IoT devices to connect to compatible servers via BluetoothÂ® gateways. The protocol provides an interoperable communication standard and example code for wire-free communication between PAYG devices and an IoT server using smartphones as gateways.

### AirLink Use

#### AirLink Data transfer flow
AirLink leverages Bluetooth and GSM to flow data from the device to the server via the app, and vice versa.

#### AirLink devices during manufacture, provisioning and use
AirLink covers the full device lifecycle, with a complete path to get devices registered in the server, exchange data and control PAYGo functionality.
![AirLink interactions during device manufacture, provisioning and use](AirLink%20Docs/IoT_Communications_and_Components_spec_-_App_Architecture.png)

#### AirLink Lost/Stolen Devices Flow
Leveraging the RF connectivity, AirLink 'community-sources' device security, where anyone with an AirLink app can help find lost devices without sharing private data or compromising device PAYGo
